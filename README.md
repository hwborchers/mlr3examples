## Details

These are the results of online meetings of the Meetup group
"R User Group Rhein-Neckar" about the 'mlr3' package for "Machine
Learning with R" that took place in July and August 2020.

* July 14, 19:00-19:40 -- Introducing 'mlr3'; first steps; example
* July 28, 19:00-19:40 -- Resampling, data preparation, benchmarking
* August 11, 19:00-19:40 -- Hyperparameter tuning, additional learners

Topics of discussion were how 'mlr3' does support different aspects
of Machine Learning; how can 'mlr3' be used, pros and cons, applying
it to example data, what else is needed, etc.
